# gluon-quickfix

This package will add a cronjob that fixes some problems that rarely occur, but are easy to work around. 

### Safety checks:
To be sure, that the script is not disturbing the start and update process:
- if autoupdater is running, `exit`
- if the router started less than 5 minutes ago, `exit`

### Workarounds
- check if we have lost any neighbours, `iw dev $DEV scan`
- if dropbear is not running, reboot (probably ram was full, so more services might've crashed)
- reboot if there was a kernel (batman) error

Manual installation
===================

If you don't have this package in your firmware, you can still install it
manually on a node:

```
ROUTER_IP='your:node::ip6'
LOGIN="root@[$ROUTER_IP]"
git clone https://github.com/ffslfl/slfl-packages
cd slfl-packages/
cd gluon-quickfix/
scp -r files/* $LOGIN:/
ssh $ROUTER_IP "/etc/init.d/micrond reload;"
```
